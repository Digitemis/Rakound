Get started
===========

Once all requirements are installed and configuration file 
filled, you can simply run Rakound with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 rakound.py
    Database URI: bolt://localhost:7687
    Database user: neo4j
    Connected to database.
    🦝 > 

You will enter in an interactive shell. Enjoy!

.. note::

    If the connection fails, you need to update the configuration 
    file directly or using the config module (:ref:`Config module`).
